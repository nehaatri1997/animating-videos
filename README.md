# animating-videos

This script, animating_videos.py, is designed to automate animations in video files using Python. It provides tools to add effects, manipulate frames, and apply filters to create animated videos.

# Features
Loads video files and processes each frame.
Applies customizable animation effects (e.g., transitions, filters, or transformations).
Outputs an animated video with the applied effects.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. To run this script, you may also need to install certain libraries if the code uses them, such as:

opencv-python for video processing.
Pillow (PIL) for handling image frames.
Install the dependencies with the following command:
pip install opencv-python pillow

# Usage
Set up your video file: Place the input video file in the same directory as animating_videos.py or provide its path.

Run the script:
python animating_videos.py
Output: The script will process each frame, apply animations, and save the animated video to the specified output file path (if defined in the script).

Example Output
The processed video file will be saved to the specified path, ready for playback with animations applied.

# Code Structure
Frame Loading: Loads video frames sequentially for processing.
Frame Processing: Applies transformations, animations, or filters to each frame.
Video Saving: Compiles processed frames back into a video file, creating the animated output.

# Customization
To modify the animation effects:
Open the animating_videos.py script in a text editor.
Edit the animation functions or parameters as desired.
Re-run the script to see the effects.
